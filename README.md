In Excel, the dataset was first cleaned by removing empty rows, handling duplicates, and checking for consistency to ensure that confirmed cases equaled the sum of deaths, recovered, and active cases, with no negative values in new cases or deaths. Derived columns such as Case Fatality Rate (CFR = Deaths/Confirmed), Recovery Rate (Recovered/Confirmed), and Active % (Active/Confirmed) were created for deeper insights. Conditional formatting was applied to highlight key patternsâ€”for example, high fatality rates in red, strong recovery rates in green, and active cases in varying shades based on severity.
